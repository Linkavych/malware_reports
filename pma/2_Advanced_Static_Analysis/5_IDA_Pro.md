# IDA Pro - or Ghidra

## Lab 5-1

Analyze the malware found in the file Lab05-01.dll using only IDA Pro. The
goal of this lab is to give you hands-on experience with IDA Pro. If you’ve
already worked with IDA Pro, you may choose to ignore these questions and
focus on reverse-engineering the malware.

1. What is the address of DllMain?

> 0x1000D02E - .text

2. Use the Imports window to browse to gethostbyname. Where is the import
located?

> 0x100163CC - .idata

3. How many functions call gethostbyname?

> Called by nine (9) functions

4. Focusing on the call to gethostbyname located at 0x10001757, can you fig-
ure out which DNS request will be made?

5. How many local variables has IDA Pro recognized for the subroutine at
0x10001656?

> 23 local variables

6. How many parameters has IDA Pro recognized for the subroutine at
0x10001656?

> One parameter

7. Use the Strings window to locate the string \cmd.exe /c in the disassembly.
Where is it located?

> 0x10095b34 - xdoors_d

8. What is happening in the area of code that references \cmd.exe /c?

> This is the C2 function for the backdoor. Mainly, this functions will create the shell from which
> the attacker can operate on the target system.

9. In the same area, at 0x100101C8, it looks like dword_1008E5C4 is a global
variable that helps decide which path to take. How does the malware set
dword_1008E5C4? (Hint: Use dword_1008E5C4’s cross-references.)

> The OS version for the target system is stored in this variable.

10. A few hundred lines into the subroutine at 0x1000FF58, a series of com-
parisons use memcmp to compare strings. What happens if the string compar-
ison to robotwork is successful (when memcmp returns 0)?

> HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WorkTime is queried for its current value, returning that value. Also,
> WorkTimes is also queried for the same value and returned.

11. What does the export PSLIST do?

> It will create a snapshot of all processes running on the target system, and return that process list. It can also target
> a specific process and return information on that process.

12. Use the graph mode to graph the cross-references from sub_10004E79.
Which API functions could be called by entering this function? Based on
the API functions alone, what could you rename this function?

> GetLanguage or something similar, as the GetSystemDefaultLangID function is called to retrieve
> the language settings on the target.

13. How many Windows API functions does DllMain call directly? How many
at a depth of 2?



14. At 0x10001358, there is a call to Sleep (an API function that takes one
parameter containing the number of milliseconds to sleep). Looking
backward through the code, how long will the program sleep if this code
executes?

> 30 seconds

15. At 0x10001701 is a call to socket. What are the three parameters?

> Protocol type = 6 - IPPROTO_TCP
> Type = 1 - SOCK_STREAM
> AF = 2 - AF_INET

16. Using the MSDN page for socket and the named symbolic constants func-
tionality in IDA Pro, can you make the parameters more meaningful?
What are the parameters after you apply changes?

> See above

17. Search for usage of the in instruction (opcode 0xED). This instruction is
used with a magic string VMXh to perform VMware detection. Is that in use
in this malware? Using the cross-references to the function that executes
the in instruction, is there further evidence of VMware detection?

> Yes it is being used. The function is referenced three (3) times in the sample.
> The string 'Found Virtual Machine. Install cancel." is also present.

18. Jump your cursor to 0x1001D988. What do you find?

> Unknown random data.

19. If you have the IDA Python plug-in installed (included with the com-
mercial version of IDA Pro), run Lab05-01.py, an IDA Pro Python script
provided with the malware for this book. (Make sure the cursor is at
0x1001D988.) What happens after you run the script?

> XORs the data with 0x55

20. With the cursor in the same location, how do you turn this data into a
single ASCII string?

> Hit 'A'
> xdoor is this backdoor, string decoded for practical malware analysis

21. Open the script with a text editor. How does it work?

> XORs up to 50 bytes of data with 0x55.
