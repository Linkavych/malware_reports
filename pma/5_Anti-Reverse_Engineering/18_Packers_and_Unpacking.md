# Packers and Unpacking

Your goal for the labs in this chapter is simply to unpack the code for further
analysis. For each lab, you should try to unpack the code so that other static
analysis techniques can be used. While you may be able to find an automated
unpacker that will work with some of these labs, automated unpackers wonâ€™t
help you learn the skills you need when you encounter custom packers. Also,
once you master unpacking, you may be able to manually unpack a file in less
time than it takes to find, download, and use an automated unpacker.
Each lab is a packed version of a lab from a previous chapter. Your task in
each case is to unpack the lab and identify the chapter in which it appeared.
The files are Lab18-01.exe through Lab18-05.exe.

## Lab18-01

This sample can be unpacked using UPX from the command line. It could also be unpacked
manually if required, but with UPX it is usually easiest to use the command line tool. In this case
the sample has been modified, and requires manual unpacking even though UPX was used.

# Lab18-02

This sample is packed using FSG 1.0. Looking at the program in the debugger, eventually the unpacking stub will jump to
0x401090. This region of code is not disassembled yet in the debugger. After a few manual steps, 
place a breakpoint here and run. Then dump the process with OllyDebugEx for x32dbg.
