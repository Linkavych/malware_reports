# Malware Traffic Analysis - January 2023

## Scenario

When did this activity first occur? Format your answer as Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). When sharing threat intelligence, UTC ensures recipients understand the exact time regardless of time zone.

Can you identify the infected host? For a Windows computer, the basic identifiers are the following:

- Victim’s IP address
- Victim’s MAC address
- Victim’s Windows host name
- Victim’s WIndows user account name

This month, our infected host is a stand-alone Windows client. In addition to Windows system traffic, the pcap also contains unencrypted SMTP traffic generated by the malware. This traffic contains additional information, so we can determine all four of the above identifiers.

The SMTP traffic includes various login credentials from the infected host. Of note, this traffic does not contain legitimate credentials. We populated the host with fake login data before we ran the malware. Despite the fake data, this traffic provides a better understanding of data stolen by Agent Tesla variants like OriginLogger.

Review the pcap and answer the following questions for this month’s Unit 42 Wireshark quiz:

- When did the malicious traffic start in UTC?
- What is the victim’s IP address?
- What is the victim’s MAC address?
- What is the victim’s Windows host name?
- What is the victim’s Windows user account name?
- How much RAM does the victim’s host have?
- What type of CPU is used by the victim’s host?
- What is the public IP address of the victim’s host?
- What type of account login data was stolen by the malware?
