# Incident Report - November 2020 - Quiz

This pcap contains traffic related to a probabl [Ursnif]() compromise on the target system.

## Local Computer
- 10.11.10.149
    - Hostname: DESKTOP-FX23IK5
    - MAC: 00:08:02:1c:47:ae

## Summary

At approximately 21:07 UTC on 10 November 2020 the first suspicious `GET` request is made using
a format common to Ursnif: `GET /images/MxV0wyr4toDRI/UIr_2BY1/mF10P3cj1NniR7TlNj4p1br/T_2FkOfFBs/EF2ScIt6s4vdMGY7z/XecWbLwjpIGf/Mi7haGArUCX/aa9Bv3j_2FVc7h/rSullDd6Pl4d6OGJpvNzx/DZ05HdIFno51IA73/lQZpflLL/_2FCr.avi HTTP/1.1\r\n`.
This was made to the domain `firestore.googleapis[.]com` at IP `172.217.18[.]170`. The provided alerts also highlight this
traffic as Ursnif.

Following this traffic, the system sends DNS request to OpenDNS, another common trait of Ursnif. This traffic will return the
compromised computer's public IP address.

The compromised target goes on to make several more DNS requests for domains in the `.club` TLD, which is not normal traffic.
Again, however, this is commonly seen in Ursnif malware traffic.

- volerunoku[.]club - 162.255.119[.]99
- folerunoku[.]club - 192.64.119[.]30
- gerometony[.]club - 192.64.119[.]118

These requests are followed by SYN packets, but no established C2 communications.

The compromised system goes on to download to RAR files from IP `89.38.225[.]160`, which is also suspicious traffic and
is likely additional stages of malware being pulled down to the system. Then the compromised system begins encrypted
C2 with the IP `94.198.40[.]26` which is using a TLS certificate common in Ursnif C2 traffic.
