# Incident Report - June 2020 Exercise

## Notes

10.6.12.157 - DESKTOP-86J4BX - 00:11:75:68:42:d3 - ted.brokowski
10.6.12.203 - LAPTOP-5WKHX9YG - 84:3a:4b:6d:fc:e2 - frank.brokowski

## Summary of Events
At approximately 17:14 UTC on 12 June 2020, user Ted Brokowski downloaded a malicious office document
from `cardboardspaceshiptoys[.]com` (172.93.120[.]242) at URI `/logs/invoice-86495.doc`. This request is redirected 
to the same URL/URI but on HTTPS. The encrypted traffic following this query to the HTTPs site suggests
data was transfered to the target system - likely the potentially malicious word document. However, there is not additional
traffic available in the packet capture which confirms malicious activity for this host - though
it is likely.

At 17:15 UTC the host at 10.6.12.203 sends a `GET` request to `205.185.125[.]104` to URI
`/pQBtWj`, and `/files/june11.dll`. The first request redirects to the DLL location for download.
A DLL is downloaded to the target system with a sha256 hash of `d36366666b407fe5527b96696377ee7ba9b609c8ef4561fa76af218ddd764dec`.
This dll is recognized as malicious, and is likely [ZLoader](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.zloader).

Following the download and execution of this DLL, there is post-infection traffic seen
to the domain `snnmnkxdhflwgthqismb[.]com` at IP address `5.101.51[.]151`. Each `POST` request sent
to the domain appeares to be sending encrypted data, and receiving a significant amount
of encrypted data in return.
