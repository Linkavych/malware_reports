### Background on the Infection

This infection was caused by a malicious Excel spreadsheet.
It has macros designed to infect a vulnerable Windows host, so I infected one in my lab.
Default settings in recent versions of Microsoft Office would prevent these type of macros from causing an infection.
This is much more effective against older versions of Windows like Windows 7.

What is the malware?
