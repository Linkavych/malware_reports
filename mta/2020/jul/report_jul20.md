## Summary of Events

At approxmiately 00:25 UTC on July 31, 2020 the system at IP address 10.7.31.101, belonging to the user 
Gregory Simmons, made a `GET` request to the domain `e-dsm.com[.]br` at IP address `191.6.208[.]51`.
This request downloaded a malicious document file titled `INVOICE-ORB85-923315.doc`. THe sha256 hash of the
document is `537ceaaf4b76967b916c857bf8113e6b6ccc65dca06df2d300b66b8a61d9eedc`, and is identified
as malicious on [Virus Total](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/537ceaaf4b76967b916c857bf8113e6b6ccc65dca06df2d300b66b8a61d9eedc).

The sample document is detected as belonging to the [Emotet](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.emotet) family of malware. The report from
[Hatching Triage](https://tria.ge/220915-byjdjabfg2) gives a clearer view of what the malware is configured to do - which is to
download a second stage malware to the targeted system.

Immediately following the document download at 00:26 UTC the compromised Windows system makes
a `GET` request to `jambino[.]us` at IP address `67.20.112[.]81`. The request is made to the URI 
`/tv/DYsPb` and returns a Windows executable with the name `3tknamb7298632293.exe`. The sha256 hash
for the sample is `0a3aaa398a6abe7a4ba256812b8b6632fa4595b4ac5c47b459d5a6a911c2d202`. This sample
is also identified as belonging to Emotet.

The compromised machine then begins to communicate with two different systems with a series of `POST` 
requests, and a single `GET` request. The `POST` requests are made to IP addresses
`201.235.10[.]215` and `104.236.52[.]89:8080` using HTTP, but the content is encrypted. A single `GET`
request is made to `104.236.52[.]89:8080` to URI `/whoami.php` which returns another IP address
`173.66.6[.]97`, but this is not found in the traffic.

The packet capture ends at 1:15 UTC with the compromised system continuing to issue `POST`
requests with data to both C2 servers.
