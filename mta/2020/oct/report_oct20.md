# Incident Report - Omegacast - October 2020

## Local System Information
- 10.72.33.165
    - Name: DESKTOP-5I7XDSY
    - User: Byron Ostrander
    - Username: byron.ostrander

## Summary of Events

At approximately 20:34 UTC on 22 October 2020, IP `10.72.33.165` (user Byron Ostrander), made a `POST` request
to a known malicious IP address `188.226.165[.]170:8080`. No DNS name resolution took place. As a malicious word document was discovered on
the compromised system, it can be assumed the user enabled the documents macro features which then began the process
of downloading the next stage of malware. The computer shows signs of compromise by Trickbot and Emotet malware.

The malware makes several requests to multiple IP addresses over the course of the PCAP.

- 104.236.52[.]89:8080
- 45.89.127[.]92:443
- 162.214.68[.]171:8080

All of the above IP addresses receive POST requests of encrypted data from the comrpromised system throughout
the PCAP file. Additionally, at 20:36 UTC the comrpromised system begins communicating with IP `103.109.78[.]174` over port 449
and `45.148.120[.]152` over port 447. Both of these communications channels are encrypted with default certificates.

Towards the end of the traffic capture there is communication occuring to several other IP addresses over ports 465, 25, 449, and 587.
All of this traffic is encrypted. The IP addresses involved are:

- 184.107.72[.]6 465
- 77.88.21[.]158 25
- 173.194.66[.]109 25
