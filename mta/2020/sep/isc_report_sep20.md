# Incident Report - ISC Diary - September 2020

At approximately 22:18 UTC on 14 September 2020 the system at IP `10.9.14.101` made a `GET` request to `vespucci[.]hu`. The
resolved IP address for this domain is `81.0.64[.]6`, and the `GET` request was made to the URI `GET /en/https://esp/EP7XgGDqdit/ HTTP/1.1\r\n`.
This request returns a significant amount of data, but is missing 1382 bytes. Based on the strings in the data
it appears to return a office document file of some type, which likely includes malicious macros.

Immediately following this download, another `GET` request is made to `kinotheque[.]com` at IP `185.66.41[.]24`.
This request is made to the URI `/wp-includes/os/` and returns a Windows executable named `8xz8c2Splm56N.exe`.

The downloaded file has the sha256sum of `bfb1f6a060d4b12905cdcef7dc83a5ff1268f62a5408a5a19ef3614e48e6c6fb`, and returns as
belonging to [Emotet](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.emotet according to [Virus Total](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/bfb1f6a060d4b12905cdcef7dc83a5ff1268f62a5408a5a19ef3614e48e6c6fb).

Following the download of this malware, the system then begins to communicate with several different C2 servers
with a series of `POST` requests that are encrypted. They are likely exfiltrating information related to the target system.

These requests are sent directly to the target IP addresses, without resolving a domain name - suggesting they are hard-coded within
the malware.
