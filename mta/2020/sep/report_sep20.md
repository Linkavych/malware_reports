The file is a Windows executable with the sha256 hash of `1e4b7d7868d25071db67da87392fd5dafab344a9fa6dc040f7afb0699152fc13`. Based on initial analysis
the file is written in .NET. [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/1e4b7d7868d25071db67da87392fd5dafab344a9fa6dc040f7afb0699152fc13) identifies the sample as belonging to the [Remcos](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.remcos) family of malware. 
However, based on the .NET fact, this malware sample is more likely to be [Agent Tesla](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.agent_tesla).

The last alert from the provided alerts confirms that this is Agent Tesla malware, which is using
SMTP to exfiltrate data. This data exil is using the domain `mail.big3.icu` at IP `185.61.152[.]63` for sending its
