LAN segment data:

- LAN segment range:  192.168.1.0/24 (192.168.1.0 through 192.168.1.255)
- Domain:  spoonwatch.net
- Domain controller:  192.168.1.9 - SPOONWATCH-DC
- LAN segment gateway:  192.168.1.1
- LAN segment broadcast address:  192.168.1.255

## Task


Write an incident report based on the pcap and the alerts.

The incident report should contains 3 sections:

- Executive Summary: State in simple, direct terms what happened (when, who, what).
- Details: Details of the victim (hostname, IP address, MAC address, Windows user account name).
- Indicators of Compromise (IOCs): IP addresses, domains and URLs associated with the infection.  SHA256 hashes if any malware binaries can be extracted from the pcap.
