# Incident Report - March 2022

## Detailed Analysis

At 20:58 UTC on 21 March 2022 a GET request was made from Patrick Zimmerman's system to `oceriesfornot[.]top` at IP `188.166.154.118`. Searching for this
domain in Google, the first hit is for a [DFIRReport](https://thedfirreport.com/2022/04/25/quantum-ransomware/) article that associates this
domain with the IcedID malware family.

This initial infection with IcedID eventually leads to Cobalt Strike on the target system.
