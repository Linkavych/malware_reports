# Incident Report - February 2022 - SunnyStation

## Executive Summary
 At 18:24 UTC multiple systems were infected with Emotet and Formbook/XLoader malware in this environment. The Emotet infectioins also produced consistent Spambot activity.


## Detailed Analysis

At 18:24 UTC on 23 February 2022 user Nick Montgomery's system issued a GET request to the domain `www.ajaxmatters[.]com` at IP `64.34.171[.]228` and URI `/c7g8t/zbBYgukXYxzAF2hZc/`. This initial
GET request returned a Windows DLL binary named `2mIaAtxprmXlTLZeFjkIqbexiFXkZkJ.dll`. 
The file has the sha256 hash value of `14b57211308ac8ad2a63c965783d9ba1c2d1930d0cafd884374d143a481f9bf3`. According to MalwareBazaar and VirusTotal
this sample belongs to the Emotet family of malware.

Further, we cna see Emotet's spambot activity associated with .149's system as well:

At 18:25 UTC the system operated by Everett French (170) visits the webpage `dalgahavuzu[.]com` at IP `178.211.56[.]194`. [URLhaus](https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/host/dalgahavuzu.com/) shows
this URL as also being associated with Emotet malware. This is likely the initial infection vector for this system.

Finally, at 18:29 UTC the system associated with Tricia Becker downloads a JPG from `159.96.154[.]210` named `Ocklqc.jpg`. This file is actually a reversed DLL, meaning the byte order is reversed. This is easy to fix on a 
linux host with the follow command:

```shell
$ < Ocklqc.jpg xxd -p -c1 | tac | xxd -r -p > Ocklqc.bin
```

This gives us the corrected DLL with a sha256 hash of `c7fe6fe3e567e3e4c5b43f08c723f5b8b22eb02c1ab3f9f7c5f659bb06b2e240`. Immediately after it has been downloaded
we see the compromised system begin to communicate with multiple C2 servers to exfiltrate data from the target.
