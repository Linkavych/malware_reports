[VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/f25a780095730701efac67e9d5b84bc289afea56d96d8aff8a44af69ae606404/detection) confirms this is Trickbot. Additionally,
the configuration can be extracted from the Trickbot sample:

```json
{
  "ver": "100019",
  "gtag": "rob124",
  "servs": [
    "65.152.201.203:443",
    "185.56.175.122:443",
    "46.99.175.217:443",
    "179.189.229.254:443",
    "46.99.175.149:443",
    "181.129.167.82:443",
    "216.166.148.187:443",
    "46.99.188.223:443",
    "128.201.76.252:443",
    "62.99.79.77:443",
    "60.51.47.65:443",
    "24.162.214.166:443",
    "45.36.99.184:443",
    "97.83.40.67:443",
    "184.74.99.214:443",
    "103.105.254.17:443",
    "62.99.76.213:443",
    "82.159.149.52:443"
  ],
  "autorun": [
    "pwgrabb",
    "pwgrabc"
  ],
  "ecc_key": "RUNTMzAAAABbfmkJRvwyw7iFkX40hL2HwsUeOSZZZo0FRRWGkY6J1+gf3YKq13Ee4sY3Jb9/0myCr0MwzNK1K2l5yuY87nW29Q/yjMJG0ISDj0HNBC3G+ZGta6Oi9QkjCwnNGbw2hQ4="
}
```

Next, we can observe the Trickbot C2 communication throughout the remainder of the PCAP. All of the identified servers are
using self-signed certificates with the default values.

Finally, examining the single POST request in more detail shows the tasking given to the Trickbot malware and the data it is exfiltrating:
