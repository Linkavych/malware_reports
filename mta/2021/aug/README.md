The incident report should contains 3 sections:

- Executive Summary: State in simple, direct terms what happened (when, who, what).
- Details: Details of the victim (hostname, IP address, MAC address, Windows user account name).
- Indicators of Compromise (IOCs): IP addresses, domains and URLs associated with the infection.  SHA256 hashes if any malware binaries can be extracted from the pcap.
