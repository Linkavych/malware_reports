- LAN segment range:  10.9.10.0/24 (10.9.10.0 through 10.9.10.255)
- Domain:  angrypoutine.com
- Domain controller:  10.9.10.9 - ANGRYPOUTINE-DC
- LAN segment gateway:  10.9.10.1
- LAN segment broadcast address:  10.9.10.255

## Task

Write an incident report based on the pcap and the alerts.

The incident report should contains 3 sections:

- Executive Summary: State in simple, direct terms what happened (when, who, what).
- Details: Details of the victim (hostname, IP address, MAC address, Windows user account name).
- Indicators of Compromise (IOCs): IP addresses, domains and URLs associated with the infection.  SHA256 hashes if any malware binaries can be extracted from the pcap.
